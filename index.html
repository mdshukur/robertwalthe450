Whether you want to relax, hike through the meadows or cycle along the Elbe, you'll find what you need here. We are located near the beautiful old town of Lauenburg, where you can step back in time with a walk through historic half-timbered architecture. We also live in the house, but we will always let you have your privacy. You will have your own space that is fully furnished and has everything you need to have a good time, cook a little and sleep well. We are looking forward to your visit!</p>
